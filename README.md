## Timeline
This timeline provides a comprehensive overview of the research phases undertaken throughout 2024, detailing the various experimental procedures, iterations, and technological advancements at each stage. The project focuses on applying Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) to taxonomy, aiming to enhance taxonomic classification and morphological matrix processing through AI-driven methodologies. The research is systematically divided into three primary phases, each addressing distinct technical challenges and refining AI-assisted taxonomic processes.

> ### Timeline Outline
*  **February 28, 2024 – June 12, 2024: Pre-Test Module** This phase primarily focused on conducting pre-tests to assess the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in taxonomic research. The initial steps involved selecting appropriate taxonomic datasets, evaluating different LLMs for their suitability, and designing experimental workflows. During this phase, key challenges such as AI hallucination and data processing limitations were identified. Various techniques, including knowledge graphs and prompt engineering, were explored to mitigate these issues. Additionally, preliminary tests were conducted to assess the accuracy of AI-assisted taxonomic descriptions and classifications. The findings from this stage provided critical insights that guided the refinement of AI models in later phases.
-  **June 14, 2024 – October 11, 2024: TaxonGPT – Taxonomic Classification with Generative AI**: Building upon the insights gained from the pre-test module, this phase aimed to integrate AI models into concrete taxonomic classification tasks. The focus was on improving model accuracy, reducing AI-induced errors, and optimizing data processing workflows. A major outcome of this phase was the development of a pipeline capable of converting morphological matrices into taxonomic descriptions and taxonomic keys. Key methodologies, such as distributed execution, recursive design, and context-aware processing, were incorporated to enhance result accuracy and reproducibility. This phase also involved manuscript preparation and submission to academic journals for peer review, ensuring the scientific rigor of the proposed methodologies.
*  **August 12, 2024 – November 12, 2024: DtoM – Taxonomic Natural Language Processing**: In the final phase, the research shifted focus to developing an advanced AI-driven "Description to Matrix" (DtoM) process. This involved designing multiple simulation-based experiments to optimize pipeline construction, refine the coding framework, and improve workflow efficiency. The iterative design process helped minimize AI hallucination and enhance result reproducibility. By integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and recursive design strategies, the final DtoM system was successfully developed and validated. The outcomes of this phase were documented in a thesis, culminating in a comprehensive study on AI-driven taxonomy.
