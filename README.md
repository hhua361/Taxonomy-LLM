# Investigating the Application of Generative Artifical Intelligence in Taxonomy

## Abstract
Taxonomy is essential for biological sciences but remains a labor-intensive process that heavily depends on expert knowledge. The advent of large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to automate and enhance taxonomic workflows, reducing subjectivity and improving efficiency. This study explores the application of LLMs in taxonomy through two key AI-driven pipelines: DtoM (Description to Matrix) and TaxonGPT, both designed to improve taxonomic description processing, species classification, and taxonomic key generation.

DtoM is a structured pipeline that extracts morphological characters from unstructured taxonomic descriptions and converts them into structured matrices, improving interoperability with existing taxonomic databases. TaxonGPT is an LLM-powered classification system that employs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and knowledge graph-based prompting to enhance contextual accuracy while minimizing AI hallucinations. The performance of these models was evaluated using 11 real-world taxonomic datasets, comparing their accuracy, efficiency, and reproducibility against conventional methods.

Results indicate that DtoM achieves near-perfect accuracy (>99%) in morphological character extraction, significantly outperforming traditional manual-based workflows​. Meanwhile, TaxonGPT consistently generated correct taxonomic keys with 100% accuracy, exceeding the web-based GPT-4o model (79.9% accuracy for complex datasets)​. In terms of efficiency, TaxonGPT’s classification speed correlates with dataset complexity, but remains computationally viable, with taxonomic key generation costing under $1 per dataset​. Additionally, incorporating knowledge graphs improved semantic understanding, enhancing classification accuracy, particularly in complex datasets​.

Despite these advancements, challenges persist in model interpretability, domain-specific biases, and computational costs associated with scaling LLM-driven taxonomy. This study provides a foundation for AI-powered taxonomy, demonstrating the feasibility of LLMs in automating taxonomic tasks while maintaining high accuracy. The findings suggest that integrating AI with expert-driven workflows can significantly accelerate biodiversity research, facilitate large-scale taxonomic data standardization, and support conservation efforts.

## Overview
> ### Chapter Brief:
*  **Chapter 2: Pre-Experimental Testing.** This chapter explores the initial application of LLMs in taxonomy through two core tasks: processing taxonomic descriptions and species classification. To address AI hallucinations, we employed prompt engineering and structured semantic approaches, such as knowledge graphs, to enhance reliability. The chapter details prompt design strategies and discusses the integration of knowledge graphs to improve taxonomic research.
-  **Chapter 3: DtoM: Taxonomic Natural Language Processing.** Building on preliminary findings, this chapter explores the application of LLMs to specific taxonomic tasks through three simulation processes: (1) Character List-Based Taxonomic Matrix Extraction and Comparative Analysis, (2) Taxonomic Matrix Extraction and Accuracy Assessment, and (3) Comparative Analysis of Taxonomic Matrix Extraction Using Descriptive Content. To further investigate NLP challenges in taxonomy, we developed the DtoM (Description to Matrix) workflow within a Python environment, integrating an LLM API to convert taxonomic descriptions into structured morphological matrices. The workflow was tested using accurate taxonomic data, and its output was evaluated for quality and accuracy, assessing the performance of DtoM in taxonomic NLP.
*  **Chapter 4: TaxonGPT: Taxonomic Classification Using Generative Artificial Intelligence.** This chapter expands on the potential of LLMs in taxonomic research, addressing AI hallucinations and evaluating their performance in NLP tasks. We assess the feasibility of applying LLMs to taxonomy by exploring whether they can generate meaningful taxonomic descriptions from morphological matrices, classify species, and construct taxonomic keys. To achieve this, we developed TaxonGPT, a Python-based program integrating an LLM API for taxonomic data processing. To enhance accuracy and reliability, we incorporated recursive validation loops utilizing LLMs’ self-checking capabilities. The generated taxonomic descriptions and keys were rigorously evaluated using accurate taxonomic data and compared against existing taxonomic software. Evaluation criteria included output quality (using the E<sub>Dicho</sub> metric), classification accuracy, and additional factors such as efficiency, cost-effectiveness, execution time, and reproducibility.

## Timeline
This timeline provides a comprehensive overview of the research phases undertaken throughout 2024, detailing the various experimental procedures, iterations, and technological advancements at each stage. The project focuses on applying Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) to taxonomy, aiming to enhance taxonomic classification and morphological matrix processing through AI-driven methodologies. The research is systematically divided into three primary phases, each addressing distinct technical challenges and refining AI-assisted taxonomic processes.

> ### Timeline Outline
*  **February 28, 2024 – June 12, 2024: Pre-Test Module** This phase primarily focused on conducting pre-tests to assess the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in taxonomic research. The initial steps involved selecting appropriate taxonomic datasets, evaluating different LLMs for their suitability, and designing experimental workflows. During this phase, key challenges such as AI hallucination and data processing limitations were identified. Various techniques, including knowledge graphs and prompt engineering, were explored to mitigate these issues. Additionally, preliminary tests were conducted to assess the accuracy of AI-assisted taxonomic descriptions and classifications. The findings from this stage provided critical insights that guided the refinement of AI models in later phases.
-  **June 14, 2024 – October 11, 2024: TaxonGPT – Taxonomic Classification with Generative AI**: Building upon the insights gained from the pre-test module, this phase aimed to integrate AI models into concrete taxonomic classification tasks. The focus was on improving model accuracy, reducing AI-induced errors, and optimizing data processing workflows. A major outcome of this phase was the development of a pipeline capable of converting morphological matrices into taxonomic descriptions and taxonomic keys. Key methodologies, such as distributed execution, recursive design, and context-aware processing, were incorporated to enhance result accuracy and reproducibility. This phase also involved manuscript preparation and submission to academic journals for peer review, ensuring the scientific rigor of the proposed methodologies.
*  **August 12, 2024 – November 12, 2024: DtoM – Taxonomic Natural Language Processing**: In the final phase, the research shifted focus to developing an advanced AI-driven "Description to Matrix" (DtoM) process. This involved designing multiple simulation-based experiments to optimize pipeline construction, refine the coding framework, and improve workflow efficiency. The iterative design process helped minimize AI hallucination and enhance result reproducibility. By integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and recursive design strategies, the final DtoM system was successfully developed and validated. The outcomes of this phase were documented in a thesis, culminating in a comprehensive study on AI-driven taxonomy.
