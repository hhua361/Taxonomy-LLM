Spikelet-bearing axes persistent. Spikelets paired; not secund; consistently in ‘long-and-short’ combinations (male), or not in distinct ‘long-and-short’ combinations (female).
Female-sterile spikelets. Male spikelets in pairs, two-flowered, with many-nerved, membranous glumes. Lemmas and paleas hyaline, the florets with three stamens and two cuneate lodicules.
Female-fertile spikelets, florets, fruit. Spikelets not noticeably compressed to compressed dorsiventrally; not disarticulating. Rachilla terminated by a female-fertile floret. Hairy callus absent. Glumes two; more or less equal; long relative to the adjacent lemmas; awnless. Upper glume 0 nerved. Spikelets with incomplete florets. The incomplete florets proximal to the female-fertile florets. The proximal incomplete florets 1; sterile. The proximal lemmas awnless. Female-fertile florets 1. Lemmas awnless; non-carinate; 3 nerved. Palea present; relatively long. Lodicules absent. Stamens 0. Ovary glabrous. Stigmas 2 (at tip of style); white to red pigmented (or green). Fruit medium sized. Hilum short.
Photosynthetic pathway, leaf blade anatomy. C4; biochemical type NADP–ME; XyMS–. Midrib conspicuous; having a conventional arc of bundles; with colourless tissue adaxially. Many of the smallest vascular bundles unaccompanied by sclerenchyma.
Special diagnostic feature. Fruiting inflorescence a massive, spatheate cob, the fruits in many rows.
